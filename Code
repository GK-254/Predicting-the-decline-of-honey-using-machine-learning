Data Collection
The first step in any machine learning project is to collect data. In this case, we will use a dataset containing information on the physicochemical properties of different types of honey. You can download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Honey+production.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('honey.csv')

# Drop any rows with missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Split the data into input features (X) and output variable (y)
X = df.drop('quality', axis=1)
y = df['quality']

# Scale the input features
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the SVM model
model = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
import joblib

# Save the trained model to a file
joblib.dump(model, 'honey_quality_model.pkl')
